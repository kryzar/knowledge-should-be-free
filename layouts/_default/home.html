{{/* So the default behavior for this file
     (`layouts/_default/home.html`) is to range through all the regular
     pages of the website. Then, each section has its own range, defined
     by the default `list.html`. This file also gives access to
     mywebsite.com/sectionname. In my case, and at the moment, I don't
     want that, and would rather have a simpler behavior: the "Cours"
     section is ranged on the index/homepage, and mywebsite.com/cours
     is a reference to the homepage.
